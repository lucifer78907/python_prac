print("hey there!")
print("Hello", "how are you?")
print(25)   #25 is an 'int' datatype but print function will treat it as string.
print(25.55)#25.55 is a float datatype
print(25+25.55) #we can use operators with print function arguments.
#(first the '+' operator will get executed and then the result will be treated as string bcz of print function.)
print(25.55>25) #'>' is a relational operator(like: >,<,>=,<=,==,!=)which gives the result in boolian datatype (i.e 'True' and 'False')
